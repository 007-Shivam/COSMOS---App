# COSMOS 

<br>It is a community app which let us to join various communities like GDSC, GFG, Code chef, etc. through which we can learn and share new topics and ideas, also get latest updates and notifications regarding communities and grow together.<br><br>
Hi, I made this project during the Android Development COMPOSE CAMP, conducted by GDSC. The facilitator during the session was Mr. Raj Narayan Mishra. I got to learn a lot during these days and it was an amazing experience learning with GDSC.<br>

I got to have hands on experience on:<br>

-**UI design**<br>
-**APP Artitecture**<br>
-**Navigation**<br><br>

Everything was explained from the very basics so that anyone with zero experience on programming can learn. I enjoyed these days, you can as well.<br><br>

Here's the link for you to attend the pathways as well.
